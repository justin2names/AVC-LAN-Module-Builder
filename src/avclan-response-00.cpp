avclan-response-00.cpp - AVCLan library for avclan interface for Atmega328
Created by Greg Nutt 2021-11-12
Version 0.0.1

The only likely use for this module would be for testing purposes or to build a custom replacement GW Module
which would also have to interface with the other communication buses of the car.,
